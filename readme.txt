Intro:
I wanted to see if I could create a model to predict if a candidate should
be drafted in the 2015 NFL draft using historical combine data (1999-2014) and Madden 15
player ratings. I'm a big fan of the Madden games and I believe they do a good
job at rating players on their roster. I downloaded the data from the following
sites and assumed if they had a Madden rating then they should be drafted.
